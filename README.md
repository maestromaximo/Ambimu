## Overview
Ambimu is an innovative application designed to enhance your daily experiences by providing a personalized musical soundtrack that fits your current surroundings and activities. By leveraging various data inputs such as location, time, weather, and personal context, Ambimu selects or synthesizes music to match the vibe of your moment, making every step of your journey feel like a scene from a movie.

## Features

3. **Personalized Experience**:
   - Learns from your music preferences and habits to continually improve the music selection.
